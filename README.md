# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I created this portfolio using Next.js and React.js, two powerful JavaScript libraries that allow me to build efficient, dynamic, and responsive web applications.

Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance out of the box. It makes it easy to build web applications that are optimized for both search engines and users, with fast initial load times and smooth navigation.

React.js, on the other hand, is a library for building user interfaces that allows me to create reusable components and declaratively describe my UI. It makes it easy to create interactive and dynamic interfaces, and its virtual DOM system ensures that only the necessary components are re-rendered when the data changes.

Together, Next.js and React.js have allowed me to build a portfolio that showcases my skills and projects in a professional and engaging way. Thank you for visiting!
